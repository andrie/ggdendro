## Submission notes

This release fixes notes on CRAN checks, including on R-devel

Reverse dependency checks highlighted new failures on `mosaic`.  As a result
I have been communicating with the `mosaic` authors.  They have fixed their 
test suite, and submitted a new version to CRAN on 2024-02-17.

Once this new submission of `ggdendro` as well as `mosaic` is updated on CRAN,
I am unaware of any other issues.
